                <h3>To Kill a Mockingbird</h3>

                <p>A Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee, published in 1960.</p>
                Review:<br>
                6.0 stars. I know I am risking a serious “FILM AT 11” moment and a club upside the head from Captain Obvious for voicing this, but nabbit dog I still think it needs to be said…TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is one of the BEST and MOST IMPORTANT American novels ever written. Okay, I said it, and I will wait patiently while you get your DUHs and DERs out of the way and hang your “no shit” signs outside for Inspector Holmes.
Okay, now given the gruntload of reviews/ratings this book has I know I’m not the first person to wag my chin about how amazing it is. Still, I am going to chance coming off like that annoying dingleberry at the tail end of a huge porcelain party because I truly have a pile of love for this book. …(Sorry for taking the metanalogy there just now, but I promise no more poop references for the rest of the review)... So if my review can bring a few more people into the Atticus Finch Fan Club, I will be just flush with happy.
On one level, this book is a fairly straight-forward coming of age story about life in a small Alabama town during the Great Depression. It has a very slice of lifesaver warmth and simplicity to it that I think resonates with a lot of readers. It certainly does with me and I think the adjective “charm” may have been invented to describe the novel.
Despite how easing flowing the narrative is, this book is both extremely and deceptively powerful in its discussion of race, tolerance and human decency. Most importantly, this book shows us by example the courage to stand all up in the grill of injustice and say “Not today, Asshole! Not on my watch.”

                <h3>The Hunger Games</h3>
                <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Hunger_Games_cover.jpg#/media/File:The_Hunger_Games_cover.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/The_Hunger_Games_cover.jpg" alt="The Hunger Games cover.jpg" height="383" width="261"></a>
                <p>A young adult dystopian novel by Suzanne Collins, published in 2008.</p>
                Review here
                <br>
                In a post-apocalyptic future, life has turned extremely hard. Fighting poverty and hunger every day, sixteen years old hunter Katniss does absolutely everything in her power to have enough for her defenseless little sister, and a barely lucid mother. Life is hard, yet not impossible, until the one fateful day arrives. Once every year, the ever vigilant all powerful Capitol of Panem celebrates for their entertainment the “Hunger Games”, a yearly tournament where a handful representatives of each district are forced to fight in a massive arena, to the death. In a sad turn of events, young Katniss will have to fight not only for herself, but for the future of her starving family.
I think this series needs as much introduction as Lord of the Rings; but what the hey, old habits die hard. Maybe not everyone has read it, maybe not everyone has watched it, but doubt anyone has never heard of it at some point. One of the greatest dystopian fiction of all time, or at least one of the best-selling ones. A literature masterpiece? Hardly. One of the most entertaining ever? Quite possibly! Astounding world building and character development. Not a profound reading at all, but a plot perfectly balanced, fast paced and action packed; if you can withstand YA that is, and the triangle thingy. Along with Percy Jackson and Divergent, one of the pillar series that sparked my literary addiction. Highly Recommendable.

                <p>A mystery thriller novel by Dan Brown, published in 2003.</p>
                Review here<br>
                Alternate history, uchronias, and indirect criticism of faith and ideology combined into one of the most successful thriller series of all time.

The separate parts were already there
Everything was already on the table, many authors had dealt with the different ideas Brown is mixing together, and finding and recombining conspiracy theories isn´t that complicated. It´s the mix of different topics that interest many people stirred together that make it entertaining for the ones who like art or thrillers, for atheists and religious people, for the ones interested in plot or characterization, it´s just difficult to find someone who would immediately say that she/he isn´t interested in one of the plot vehicles.

            <h3>Dune Saga</h3>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dune-Frank_Herbert_(1965)_First_edition.jpg#/media/File:Dune-Frank_Herbert_(1965)_First_edition.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/de/Dune-Frank_Herbert_%281965%29_First_edition.jpg" alt="Dune-Frank Herbert (1965) First edition.jpg" height="391" width="259"></a><br>
                <p>Dune is a 1965 epic science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials (1963–64 novel Dune World and 1965 novel Prophet of Dune) in Analog magazine. It tied with Roger Zelazny's This Immortal for the Hugo Award for Best Novel and won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1966. It is the first installment of the Dune Chronicles. It is one of the world's best-selling science fiction novels..</p>
                Review <br>
                Dune.

No other single syllable means as much to the science fiction genre, a single word that conjures images of sandworms, spice wars, great battles between rival dynastic families and a massively detailed and intricately crafted universe. No wonder this is widely regarded as not just a Science Fiction masterpiece, but a literary achievement as well.

Like a study of Shakespeare, the reader finds that this is an archetype upon which many influences and imitators have based their works. The complexity and depth of the creation is staggering and I am continually astounded at the discipline with which Herbert must have focused his imagination.

This is the book upon which Herbert would base his greatest series and one that would outlive him as his son has continued to expand and add detail to the vast, immaculate tapestry woven by a true master of the genre. Encapsulating political, economic, sociological, biological, cultural and dynastic themes, Frank Herbert has set a high standard for later practitioners.

Brilliant.

                Wow.

This is a wild ride. If you like Philip K. Dick’s writing and wondered what would happen if you extended his vision into the not too distant future, if you liked Bladerunner, if you liked The Matrix … and even if you like all the film and fiction that has made an attempt to be any of the above, you will love Neuromancer.

William Gibson said that while writing Neuromancer he went to see the Ridley Scott film Bladerunner and thought that his ideas for the book were hopelessly lost, that everyone would naturally assume that he had taken all of his queues from the film. I have written that Bladerunner was that most rare of accomplishments, a film that was as good or better than the book. Bladerunner was of course patterned loosely after Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K. Dick. One reason why Bladerunner was as good was because Scott’s vision was so different from Dick’s. Bladerunner was a distinctly cyberpunk vision, whereas Dick’s was dystopian but not necessarily cyberpunk.

Dick Award, and the Hugo Award.[1] It was Gibson's debut novel and the beginning of the Sprawl trilogy. Set in the future, the novel follows Henry Case, a washed-up hacker hired for one last job, which brings him in contact with a powerful artificial intelligence. </p>
                Review here<br>
                I can't remember being this violently conflicted about a book in quite some time. There are some areas where it's so incredibly well done, with the author absolutely nailing it, and then others where I found myself grinding my teeth in frustration. I'm going to abandon my usual practice of writing short, pithy reviews and just drunkenly ramble on a few things here. (Still no spoilers, though.) That OK with y'all?

Language. About two and a half chapters into this book, I found myself asking, "Why does this feel like a YA fantasy book?" It wasn't the subject material or the plot, both of which are much more sophisticated than Harry Potter and his ilk. While I would feel perfectly comfortable having a 12-year-old read this PG13-violent and utterly asexual book, I don't feel as though it's necessarily written for tweens. Finally it occurred to me: it's the language. This book is one of the most simply written books I've ever read, using only the most basic vocabulary. That isn't a bad thing, as I'd rather read something direct and simple than something flowery and overwritten, but Sanderson's language is so simple here that it's almost as if he's drawing with the Crayola 16-set when other authors have the big 64. (One notable exception: having apparently become recently enamored of the word, he uses maladroitly at least three times. Maybe he was jamming some Weezer while he wrote.) I haven't read any of his other works (yet; Mistborn #2 is on deck), but I have to assume this simplicity is by conscious choice, and it's an interesting choice at that.
 I'm just not sure yet how I feel about it.

<h3>Hyperion</h3>

                <br>
                <p>Hyperion is a 1989 science fiction novel by American author Dan Simmons. The first book of his Hyperion Cantos series, it won the Hugo Award for best novel.[1]    The plot of the novel features multiple time-lines and characters. It follows a similar structure to The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer. The next book in the series was The Fall of Hyperion, published in 1990. </p>
                Review here<br>
                hriking the way towards one of the best epic, old mythology, and literature inspired, mindblowing, amazingly ingeniously written space operas.

The difference between the first two Hyperion parts and the third and fourth Endymion parts of the series is that the first duo is more oriented on classic mythology and literature motives transformed into a sci-fi settings, while the sequel goes full frontal space opera with anything a sci-fi readers´ hearth could wish for.

Tricky not to spoiler, because there are different characters, each one telling her/his own story that often has to do with past events that will influence the future of their mission, but let's say that Simmons does exposition like a boss, especially recognizable if one remembers elements of Hyperion when reading Endymion.

I would name, the classic, Simmons in a line with Irving, Bradbury, Sanderson, and King, because of the very rare style and his narrative competence and talent that lets the reader never lose interest and thereby connection to the world for just one second.

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>

            <p>
                <h3></h3>
                <p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_Book_Cover.jpg#/media/File:Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher's_Stone_Book_Cover.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_Book_Cover.jpg" alt="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Book Cover.jpg" height="394" width="253"></a>
                <p>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling. The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday, when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who killed Harry's parents but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old. </p>
           Review here<br>
           I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. *clears throat*
I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.
I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.
It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting.
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What's not to love?

<h3>Sun Eater Saga</h3>

            <p>
                <h3></h3>
                <p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Neuromancer_(Book).jpg#/media/File:Neuromancer_(Book).jpg"><img src="https://images1.penguinrandomhouse.com/cover/9780756419264"></a>
                <p>Hadrian Marlowe, a man revered as a hero and despised as a murderer, chronicles his tale in the galaxy-spanning debut of the Sun Eater series, merging the best of space opera and epic fantasy.

                    It was not his war.

                    The galaxy remembers him as a hero: the man who burned every last alien Cielcin from the sky. They remember him as a monster: the devil who destroyed a sun, casually annihilating four billion human lives—even the Emperor himself—against Imperial orders.

                    But Hadrian was not a hero. He was not a monster. He was not even a soldier.

                    On the wrong planet, at the right time, for the best reasons, Hadrian Marlowe starts down a path that can only end in fire. He flees his father and a future as a torturer only to be left stranded on a strange, backwater world.

                    Forced to fight as a gladiator and navigate the intrigues of a foreign planetary court, Hadrian must fight a war he did not start, for an Empire he does not love, against an enemy he will never understand.

                Review here<br>
                As for the Dune comparison side of it...I don't see it. Maybe because it's thousands of years in our future and there is a hierarchy and games of houses and things like that, I mean Dune isn't the only thing to do that. So, again, I feel like that's the wrong comparison. This is an excellent story, but I don't think it's quite as thought provoking and philosophical as what Frank Herbert did.
                If I was to make a blank meets blank comparison with this book, I'd say it's imagine Patrick Rothfuss writing the Red Rising saga. And that is not meant as a slander to Pierce Brown, one of my favorite authors working today, but a testament to Ruocchio's talents as a writer.
                Imagine Red Rising, but Darrow starts off as a Gold, Nero is his father, and Cassius is his brother
